    title: Summary
    summary: |
        I’m fortunate in that I’m passionate about my day job. Relaxing for me is coding and keeping up to date
        with technology.

        I have always invested time and effort in core skills for building software and this approach 
        has seen me pick up new skills quickly and succeed on challenging projects many times.

        I enjoy all the challenges this industry offers; delivery, leadership, technology, customer 
        satisfaction, innovation and on-going learning. Each project is different.

        I like to keep things simple, stay agile and responsive, so I can meet requirements quickly.
        I tend to design and plan my way to avoid “big-bang” deliveries, preferring an incremental approach with an
        element of fail-fast.
